# pyanywhere
This is a wrapper for the PythonAnywhere API that is currently in alpha stage of development. Here is an example showing how it works:

```python3
from pyanywhere.users import User
user = User('username', token='XXXXXXXX')

# Print names of all consoles
for console in user.get_consoles():
    print(console.name)
```
